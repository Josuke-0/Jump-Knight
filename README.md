#Jump-Knight 🛡️

🌙 The Quest Ahead

Jump-Knight is a 2D platformer written in GDScript, inspired by classic jump-and-climb games. It lets you control a knight who leaps, climbs, and attempts to ascend through levels — facing the vertigo of platforms, the weight of each jump, and the thrill of reaching higher ground.

🔧 What’s in This Package

Core game logic and player controller for movement, jumping, and collisions (written in GDScript).

Scenes and assets arranged to support platformer mechanics (tiles, platforms, player, obstacles).

A base level / “first game” scene to start — a scaffold for you to build upon, reshape, and breathe life into.
